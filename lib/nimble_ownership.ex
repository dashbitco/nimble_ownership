defmodule NimbleOwnership do
  @moduledoc """
  Module that allows you to manage ownership of resources across processes.

  The idea is that you can track ownership of terms (keys) across processes,
  and allow processes to use a key through processes that are already allowed.

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    pidA["Process A"]
    pidB["Process B"]
    pidC["Process C"]
    res(["Resource (with associated metadata)"])

    pidA -->|Owns| res
    pidA -->|Allows| pidB
    pidB -->|Can access| res
    pidB -->|Allows| pidC
    pidC -->|Can access| res
  ```

  A typical use case for such a module is tracking resource ownership across processes
  in order to isolate access to resources in **test suites**. For example, the
  [Mox][mox] library uses this module to track ownership
  of mocks across processes (in shared mode).

  ## Usage

  To track ownership of resources, you need to start a `NimbleOwnership` server (a process),
  through `start_link/1` or `child_spec/1`.

  Then, you can allow a process access to a key through `allow/4`. You can then check
  if a PID can access the given key through `fetch_owner/3`.

  ### Metadata

  You can store arbitrary metadata (`t:metadata/0`) alongside each **owned resource**.
  This metadata is returned together with the owner PID when you call `fetch_owner/3`.

  ## Modes

  The ownership server can be in one of two modes:

    * **private** (the default): in this mode, you can only allow access to a key through
      the owner PID or PIDs that are already allowed to access the key. You can allow PIDs
      through `allow/4`. This mode is useful when you want to track ownership of resources
      in concurrent environments (such as in a test suite).

    * **shared**: in this mode, there is only one *shared owner PID* that owns all the keys
      in the ownership server. Any other PID can read the metadata associated with any key,
      but it cannot update the metadata (only the shared owner can).

  > #### Returning to Private Mode {: .warning}
  >
  > If the ownership server is in *shared mode* and the shared owner process terminates,
  > the server automatically returns to *private mode*.

  ## Cleanup

  When an owner PID goes down, the ownership server automatically cleans up all the
  allowances and owned keys associated with that owner PID. If you want to **manually**
  clean up the allowances and owned keys associated with an owner PID instead, you can
  use `set_owner_to_manual_cleanup/2` and `cleanup_owner/2`. `set_owner_to_manual_cleanup/2`
  sets the owner PID to manual cleanup mode, and `cleanup_owner/2` cleans up the allowances
  and owned keys associated with the owner PID.

  This is mostly useful if you're using this library to write tests, and your tests
  are based on *expectations*, that is, you first set an expectation (that you store
  in the ownership server) and then you verify that the expectation was met when exiting
  the test. Without digging too deep, a practical example of this is [Mox][mox] and its
  `Mox.expect/3` and `Mox.verify_on_exit!/1` functions.

  Allows `pid_to_allow` to use `key` through `pid_with_access` (on the given `ownership_server`).

  Use this function when `pid_with_access` is allowed access to `key`, and you want
  to also allow `pid_to_allow` to use `key`.

  This function return an error in the following cases:

    * When `pid_to_allow` is already allowed to use `key` via **another owner PID**
      that is not the owner of `pid_with_access`. In this case, the `:reason` field of the returned
      `NimbleOwnership.Error` struct is set to `{:already_allowed, other_owner_pid}`.

    * When the ownership server is in [**shared mode**](#module-modes). In this case,
      the `:reason` field of the returned `NimbleOwnership.Error` struct is set to
      `:cant_allow_in_shared_mode`.

  > #### Tracking Callers {: .tip}
  >
  > The ownership server automatically considers all the direct and indirect "children"
  > of an owner PID as allowed to access the owner's keys. By children, we mean processes
  > that have been spawned by the owner PID or by any of its children, which is something
  > we determine by looking at the `:"$callers"` key in the process dictionary.
  > This is useful for many standard process kinds. For example, if a process owns a key
  > and starts a task with `Task.start_link/1`, then the task will be allowed to access
  > the key without having to explicitly call `allow/4`.

  ### Transitive Allowances

  Allowances are **transitive**. If `pid_with_access` allows `pid_to_allow`, it is equivalent
  to the owner of `pid_with_access` allowing `pid_to_allow`, effectively tying `pid_to_allow`
  with the owner. If `pid_with_access` terminates, `pid_to_allow` will still have access to the
  key, until the `owner_pid` itself terminates or removes the allowance.

  ### Deferred (lazy) allowances

  If the process is not yet started at the moment of allowance definition, it might be allowed
  as a function, assuming at the moment of invocation it would have been started.
  If the function cannot be resolved to a PID during invocation, the expectation will not succeed.

  The function might return a `t:pid/0` or a list of `t:pid/0`s. A list might be helpful
  if one needs to allow multiple PIDs that resolve from a single term, such as the list of workers in a pool.

  Accesses `key` (owned by `owner_pid`) or initializes the ownership.

  Use this function for these purposes:

    * to initialize the ownership of a key
    * to update the metadata associated with a key

  ## Usage

  When `owner_pid` doesn't own `key`, the value passed to `fun` will be `nil`. Otherwise,
  it will be the current metadata associated with `key` under the owner `owner_pid`.

  `fun` must return `{get_value, new_meta}`. `owner_pid` will start owning
  `key` and `new_meta` will be the metadata associated with that ownership, or,
  in case `owner_pid` already owned `key`, then the metadata is updated to `new_meta`.

  If this function is successful, the return value is `{:ok, get_value}` where `get_value`
  is the value returned by `fun` in its return tuple. Otherwise, the return value is
  `{:error, reason}` (see also `NimbleOwnership.Error`).

  > #### Allowed Processes {: .warning}
  >
  > Processes that are allowed to access `key` under `owner_pid` **cannot update the metadata
  > using this function**. Only the owner PID can update the metadata.
  >
  > If an allowed process attempts to update the metadata under `key`, this function will return
  > `{:error, ...}`. This function only works if `owner_pid` doesn't own `key` and is not
  > allowed to access `key` by any other PIDâ€”in that case, it's considered as a new ownership and
  > `fun` receives `nil`.
  >
  > See the examples below for more information.

  ### Updating Metadata from an Allowed Process

  If you don't directly have access to the owner PID, but you want to update the metadata
  associated with the owner PID and `key` *from an allowed process*, do this instead:

    1. Fetch the owner of `key` through `fetch_owner/3`.
    2. Call `get_and_update/4` with the owner PID as `owner_pid`, passing in a callback
       function that returns the new metadata.

  ### Shared Mode

  When the ownership server is set to **shared mode**, you can only call this function
  with `owner_pid` set to the shared owner PID. See [the module documentation](#module-modes).

  ## Examples

  Initializing the ownership of a key:

      iex> pid = spawn(fn -> Process.sleep(:infinity) end)

      iex> NimbleOwnership.get_and_update(server, pid, :my_key, fn current -> {current, 2} end)
      {:ok, 1}

  If one of the `callers` owns `key` or is allowed access to `key`,

  metadata associated with the `key` under the owner.

  If the ownership server is in [**shared mode**](#module-modes), then this function
  returns `{:shared_owner, shared_owner_pid}` where `shared_owner_pid` is the PID of the
