defmodule NimbleOwnership do
  @moduledoc """
  Module that allows you to manage ownership of resources across processes.

  The idea is that you can track ownership of terms (keys) across processes,
  and allow processes to use a key through processes that are already allowed.

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    pidA["Process A"]
    pidB["Process B"]
    pidC["Process C"]
    res(["Resource (with associated metadata)"])

    pidA -->|Owns| res
    pidA -->|Allows| pidB
    pidB -->|Can access| res
    pidB -->|Allows| pidC
    pidC -->|Can access| res
  ```

  A typical use case for such a module is tracking resource ownership across processes
  in order to isolate access to resources in **test suites**. For example, the
  [Mox](https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html) library uses this module to track ownership
  of mocks across processes (in shared mode).

  ## Usage

  To track ownership of resources, you need to start a `NimbleOwnership` server (a process),
  through `start_link/1` or `child_spec/1`.

  Then, you can allow a process access to a key through `allow/4`. You can then check
  if a PID can access the given key through `fetch_owner/3`.

  ### Metadata

  You can store arbitrary metadata (`t:metadata/0`) alongside each **owned resource**.
  This metadata is returned together with the owner PID when you call `fetch_owner/3`.

  ## Modes

  The ownership server can be in one of two modes:

    * **private** (the default): in this mode, you can only allow access to a key through
      the owner PID or PIDs that are already allowed to access the key. You can allow PIDs
      through `allow/4`. This mode is useful when you want to track ownership of resources
      in concurrent environments (such as in a test suite).

    * **shared**: in this mode, there is only one *shared owner PID* that owns all the keys
      in the ownership server. Any other PID can read the metadata associated with any key,
      but it cannot update the metadata (only the shared owner can).

  > #### Returning to Private Mode {: .warning}
  >
  > If the ownership server is in *shared mode* and the shared owner process terminates,
  > the server automatically returns to *private mode*.

  Use this function when `owner_pid` is allowed access to `key`, and you want
  to also allow `pid_to_allow` to use `key`.

  This function return an error in the following cases:

    * When `pid_to_allow` is already allowed to use `key` via **another owner PID**
      that is not `owner_pid`. In this case, the `:reason` field of the returned
      `NimbleOwnership.Error` struct is set to `{:already_allowed, other_owner_pid}`.

    * When the ownership server is in [**shared mode**](#module-modes). In this case,
      the `:reason` field of the returned `NimbleOwnership.Error` struct is set to
      `:cant_allow_in_shared_mode`.

  > #### Tracking Callers {: .tip}
  >
  > The ownership server automatically considers all the direct and indirect "children"
  > of an owner PID as allowed to access the owner's keys. By children, we mean processes
  > that have been spawned by the owner PID or by any of its children, which is something
  > we determine by looking at the `:"$callers"` key in the process dictionary.
  > This is useful for many standard process kinds. For example, if a process owns a key
  > and starts a task with `Task.start_link/1`, then the task will be allowed to access
  > the key without having to explicitly call `allow/4`.

  Accesses `key` (owned by `owner_pid`) or initializes the ownership.

  Use this function for these purposes:

    * to initialize the ownership of a key
    * to update the metadata associated with a key

  ## Usage

  When `owner_pid` doesn't own `key`, the value passed to `fun` will be `nil`. Otherwise,
  it will be the current metadata associated with `key` under the owner `owner_pid`.

  `fun` must return `{get_value, new_meta}`. `owner_pid` will start owning
  `key` and `new_meta` will be the metadata associated with that ownership, or,
  in case `owner_pid` already owned `key`, then the metadata is updated to `new_meta`.

  If this function is successful, the return value is `{:ok, get_value}` where `get_value`
  is the value returned by `fun` in its return tuple. Otherwise, the return value is
  `{:error, reason}` (see also `NimbleOwnership.Error`).

  ### Updating Metadata from an Allowed Process

  If you don't directly have access to the owner PID, but you want to update the metadata
  associated with the owner PID and `key` *from an allowed process*, do this instead:

    1. Fetch the owner of `key` through `fetch_owner/3`.
    2. Call `get_and_update/4` with the owner PID as `owner_pid`, passing in a callback
       function that returns the new metadata.

  ### Shared Mode

  When the ownership server is set to **shared mode**, you can only call this function
  with `owner_pid` set to the shared owner PID. See [the module documentation](#module-modes).

  Gets the owner of `key` through one of the `callers`.

  If one of the `callers` owns `key` or is allowed access to `key`,

  metadata associated with the `key` under the owner.

  If the ownership server is in [**shared mode**](#module-modes), then this function
